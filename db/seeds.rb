  In our first article, technical project manager and CTO Audrius Zujus
  delves into the world of artificial intelligence and how top project
  managers can prepare to take on the surge of new work in AI.
  His article covers how AI projects differ from typical software development
  in terms of standard algorithms, the development lifecycle,
  and differences in team roles. With the rise of AI, new sets
  of challenges face project managers who are committed to working
  in this up-and-coming field."
